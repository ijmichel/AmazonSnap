Parser For Amazon SNAP content and plotting using SNAP

Created for Data Visualization Course to parase an Amazon Meta Data file from here:

http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html#amazon

Stanford Large Data uses SNAP, a library system to parse large data sets like the Amazon one.   

Using simple python one of the Amazon files was converted to SNAP format, saved as binary, and then written as a PNG file
for the homework assignment.
